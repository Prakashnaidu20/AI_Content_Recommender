LLM-Powered Hybrid Content Recommendation System

📌 Project Overview
This project implements an AI-based hybrid content recommendation system inspired by
platforms such as Google and YouTube. The system recommends personalized video content
based on user intent, interest, mood, and time availability using Natural Language
Processing (NLP), similarity-based machine learning models, and LLM-style reasoning.

The project is primarily implemented and evaluated inside a Jupyter Notebook for
academic analysis, with an optional Streamlit-based web application for deployment
demonstration.

🎯 Objectives
- Design a personalized content recommendation engine
- Apply NLP techniques for semantic similarity
- Implement explainable AI recommendations
- Simulate LLM-style reasoning without external APIs
- Enable video playback inside Jupyter Notebook
- Demonstrate deployment using Streamlit

🧠 System Architecture
The system follows a hybrid recommendation approach:

1. Input Layer
   - User query (interest / topic)
   - Optional context (mood, time duration)

2. Processing Layer
   - Text preprocessing
   - TF-IDF vectorization
   - Cosine similarity computation

3. Recommendation Layer
   - Ranking of content items
   - Filtering based on relevance score

4. Explanation Layer
   - LLM-style natural language reasoning
   - Transparent and interpretable outputs

5. Presentation Layer
   - Jupyter Notebook (primary evaluation)
   - Streamlit Web App (optional deployment)
